ScreenLike is (currently) a small browser extension to track your activity in the browser, as well as if you think 
a website is good for you. 

Currently, it tracks the *url* and *timestamp* of every website you visit, and allows you to download that data as a json file.

I haven't yet packaged it as a permanent extension, however.

Planned extensions:
1. Will track the "title" of each webpage
2. Will (when you use it) ask 10% of the time whether you think a tab is worthwhile
3. You can mute the ask for certain websites

Eventually, I hope to use this extension as part of an extension which trains a ML model to predict which websites will be helpful
to visit.
